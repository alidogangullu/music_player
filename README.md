This is a simple music player built using Flutter and Fluent UI. It allows you to select a folder and play FLAC and MP3 files within it using the VLC package. The application extracts information like track properties, album cover, album name, and artist from the files and displays them in the interface. It also provides functionalities to skip to the next or previous track, pause and play, and fast-forward based on the album cover for theme color.
